Complete each of the sets of steps below to prepare the lab for the activity tracking assessment for each task in the lab. 

Task 1: Create a dataset to store your machine learning models
It can be called any name to pass the test but for the remaining instructions to work use `austin` as the dataset name.

bq mk austin



Task 2: Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model.
Create the first ML model using a JOIN between two bike share tables. Again any names will work but keep them as ‘austin_1’ and ‘austin_2’ for the remaining instructions to work. 

BigQuery Console Query Editor

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.location_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes,
    address as location
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
JOIN
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON
    trips.start_station_name = stations.name
WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018
    AND duration_minutes > 0







Task 3: Create the second machine learning model. 

BigQuery Console Query Editor
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.subscriber_model
OPTIONS
  (model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2018





Task 4: Evaluate the two machine learning models.

BigQuery Console Query Editor
Query 1

-- Evaluation metrics for location_model
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse,
  mean_absolute_error
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.location_model, (
  SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes,
    address as location
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
  JOIN
   `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
  ON
    trips.start_station_name = stations.name
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019)
)




Query 2
-- Evaluation metrics for subscriber_model
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse,
  mean_absolute_error
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.subscriber_model, (
  SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
  WHERE
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019)
)








Task 5: Use the subscriber type machine learning model to predict average trip durations
Use the second model, that model (model austin_2 in this case) to to predict the average duration length of all trips from the busiest rental station in 2019 (based on the number of rentals per station in 2019) where the subscriber_type=’Single Trip’.


The following query will list busiest stations in descending order. The busiest station for 2019 was “21st & Speedway @PCL”.

BigQuery Console Query Editor
SELECT
  start_station_name,
  COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019
GROUP BY
  start_station_name
ORDER BY
  trips DESC





Then predict trip length.

BigQuery Console Query Editor
SELECT AVG(predicted_duration_minutes) AS average_predicted_trip_length
FROM ML.predict(MODEL austin.subscriber_model, (
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
WHERE 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = 2019
  AND subscriber_type = 'Single Trip'
  AND start_station_name = '21st & Speedway @PCL'))
